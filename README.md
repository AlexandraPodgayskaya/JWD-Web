## Project Overview
The web application is a payment system.  The user registered as a client can view the active cards with an actual balance, open a new card - the main or additional 
(including for another user registered in the system), replenish the balance, make a payment or transfer, view account transactions log (if the card is main) or card 
transactions log, block or close the card, as well as fill out, view and edit the profile, change the login and password.  
The administrator can find a client by his personal passport number and view all cards issued for him, including closed, as well as view transaction logs, block, 
unblock or close the card.
